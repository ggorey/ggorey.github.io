							<h1>Welcome to Grace</h1>
							<p class="major"> For ENGL 3844, we were asked to design a website. Well, welcome to that website.
							Throughout the course of the semester, we've done some research on how education has impacted our lives. I wrote a few blogs (which you can find below) and, with the help of my group, have compiled quite the collection of educational material.
						 	Below is a closer look into education. Please be sure to check out our podcast as well as a nice little video we put together for you!
							Happy exploring!!

							<h2>Did You Know Netflix Is Educational? Yeah, me neither... </h2>
							<p>
							In this <a href="https://medium.com/@ggorey/did-you-know-netflix-is-educational-yeah-me-neither-61549f36ba9d" target="_blank">medium article</a>, I tried to reach out to an audience that didn't necessarily have access to higher education like university.
						Many of us simply associate education with a classic old brick building where an old lady is yelling at you with a ruler in her hand. BUT there's so much more to it than that.
					Surprisingly enough, Netflix serves as a great tool in helping others become more educated on topics that may not have been previously heard of.
				Documentaries. It's all about the documentaries, man.

							<h2>Motivation, Education, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</h2>
							<p>In this <a href="https://medium.com/@ggorey/motivation-education-and-the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-25b83affa4b1" target="_blank">blog post</a>, I talk about how motivated learning enables us to actually soak up the knowledge we ingest. In high school specifically, works of literature are often presented to students before they can truly comprehend and enjoy them. Without intriguing discussions of a piece of literature, how are susceptible minds supposed to gain any kind of remarkable experience? </p>

By gaining experience and perspective from different cultures, <a href="https://medium.com/@ggorey/education-through-experience-71614123b212" target="_blank">education through experience</a> is something we can't take for granted.</p>

							<h2>Newfound Connection through Social Media</h2>
							<p>In this <a href="https://medium.com/@ggorey/newfound-connection-through-social-media-cb5871d97727" target="_blank">blog</a>, I talk about social media. It's something we're all aware of--if not too aware of. Communication is one of the greatest perks <!-- Can you find a more descriptive word than "things"?-->of the 21st century.
					By utilizing the simple layout of social media platforms, it's now easy to stay educated by staying informed. Without missing a beat, the invention of the smart phone has single-handedly made communication a breeze. </p>

							<h2>Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtnxLKHC0Kk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> on education!</h2>
							<p> It's not only important to discuss what education personally means to us, but we need to go out there and gain the perspectives of other like-minded students. SO one afternoon in Blacksburg, we went around compiling shots of campus as well as asking other students what education means to them. In order to get a better idea on education as a whole, we thought it best to go straight to the source. AKA the students.
